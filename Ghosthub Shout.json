They are attack helicopters, so we'll take them down. 1. Use SAMs (Surface-to-Air Missiles): Examples: Stinger, Igla, or Strela. Infantry can use them to ambush Apaches from behind hills or buildings. The Apache's weakness: If it hovers for a long time before firing, it can be detected by radar. 2. Use Anti-Aircraft Vehicles (SPAAG): Examples: Shilka, Tunguska, Gepard, or Pantsir-S1. With radar and 30mm autocannons or short-range missiles, it can hit Apaches from a distance. 3. Guerrilla Tactics: Avoid radar or infrared detection. Apaches are very reliable with FLIR sensors, so avoid them in open areas. You can attack while the Apache is refueling or landing. 4. Disrupt its Systems (Electronic Warfare): Apaches rely on radar and sensors, so jammers or EMPs can blind them. In fiction, you could add a Russian-made or similar experimental \"Signal Scrambler\" device 😎 5. Use Decoys or Hot Baits: For example, flares from vehicles or hot metal dummies. The Apache can be fooled if its missiles stray into the decoys."}
